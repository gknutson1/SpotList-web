# SpotList-web
A playlist management utility (Frontend)

The source code for the frontend functionality is held within this repository. This was originally a branch to https://github.com/gknutson1/SpotList but was adapted to it's own repository as necessary. 

The 'scripts' folder contains the JavaScript files required for the routes throughout the frontend.
The 'styles' folder contains the CSS files used to style the webpage.
The html files can be found as stand alone files representing the webpages within the application.
